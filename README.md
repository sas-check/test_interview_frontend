# Check FrontEnd Take Home Exercise

This take home test is designed to evaluate real world activities that are involved with this role. Our approach, helps ensure that you will be working with the necessary practical skills for the role.

# Instructions
Using the Star Wars API [swapi](https://swapi.dev/api/), display a list of all Star Wars planets using the endpoint “/planets”. 

For every user, we’d like to display a card with the name of each planet along with a random picture of cats using [cataas API](https://cataas.com/) for each planet. Each card should be colored based on the level of `surface_water` and have some kind of animation when the user hovers over the card. When we click on a planet’s card, more information should appear in a modal about the planet.

You are granted absolute creative freedom for the design.

-   Implement an authentication scheme.
-   Have advanced features, however, discussion of anything extra you'd expect a production client to contain would be useful in the documentation.
